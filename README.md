Designing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to visualize XML and json files
The user can:
* Check consistency of a xml file, consistency: The input XML may have inconsistencies 
  like missing any of the closing and opening tags or not matching tags. 
* Formatting (Prettifying) the XML: the XML file should be well formatted by keeping 
  the indentation for each level.
* Converting XML to JSON: JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is another format that is 
  used to represent data.
* Compressing the data in the XML/JSON file.
  Representing the users data using the graph data structure. (in progress).
* Network analysis: by representing the network using the graph data structure, we 
  can extract some important data: (in progress) 
  -   who is the most influencer user (has the most followers)
  -   who is the most active user (connected to lots of users)
  -   the mutual followers between 2 users
  -   for each user, suggest a list of users to follow (the followers of his followers)
* Post search: given a specific word or topic, get the posts where this word or topic 
  was mentioned. (in progress).
